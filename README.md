EpiStalk allows to see who is connected using "netsoul", i.e connected to the EPITA/EPITECH network.
This includes people connected in machine rooms and people connected to the Wi-Fi.
The navigation works with tabs : one to sum up the content of the others, with one tab per machine room.
There are also profile pages to get even more details about users.
